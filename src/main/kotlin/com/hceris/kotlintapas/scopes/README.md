# Scope functions

Having local variables that are only used once is not considered idiomatic _Kotlin_. There are a bunch of scope functions that allow us to process the data without needing them.

## Official Docs

https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/scope-functions.html

## Problem

- Remove all local variables from the `reverseWords` function
- Convert the function to a [single expression function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#single-expression-functions)
