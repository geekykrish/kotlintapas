# Null Safety

Unlike _Java_, _Kotlin_ distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types. If you are handling possible `null` values, you need to decide what to do with them.

The safe (`?`) operator allows you to do this without and endless amount of if/else conditions.

## Problem

- Refactor the code to avoid the `if (null)` check
