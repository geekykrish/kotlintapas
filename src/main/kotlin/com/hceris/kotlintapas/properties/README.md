# Properties

Properties are the way of having getter and setter methods in a way that you don't lose faith in programming and want to become a monk and move to a mountain.

You can do simple stuff like just having the fields, or customizing the behavior for both get and set. Things like lazy evaluation are supported as well.

## Problem

- We need a custom getter to format our fields in the `Address` before they get accessed. Write a custom property for that
- **BONUS**: If you want to get a taste of delegation early, make the properties be computed lazily
