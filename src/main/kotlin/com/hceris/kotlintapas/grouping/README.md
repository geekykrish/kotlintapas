# Grouping

When manipulating collections, sometimes we've got to group the results in some fashion. We can do it with lame for loops of course, but why not remain declarative?

## Problem

- We have built a budget Google that tokenizes and group words by relevance (i.e: word count)
- Use `groupBy` to get rid of that nasty for loop
