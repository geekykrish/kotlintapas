A higher order function is one function that receives another function, or that returns one.

_Kotlin_ compact syntax is a particular match for these kind of functions, that allow to abstract behaviors over different types. It is one of the core principles of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
