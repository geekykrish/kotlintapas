# Lambdas

Lambdas, or anonymous functions, are a powerful tool in _Kotlin_. You can use a much more declarative style by expressing the code as a number of processing steps, instead of using an imperative style.

## Problem

- Refactor the code to use the functional predicates `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
- **BONUS**: The commented test takes a while to run. What if we would rewrite the code so that we only evaluate part of the list? Say, up to a 100 elements.
