# Kotlintapas

This repository is a collection of small problems to illustrate all the cool shit that you can do with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)


## Requirements

- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the [Kotlin plugin installed](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin)
- A configured _JVM_. It can be installed using `brew`:

```
brew cask install java11
```

## Structure of the repository

Each folder in the source contains an exercise, with a README file describing what to do.

### Running the tests

Tests can be run from _IntelliJ_ or in the console by using:

```
./go test
```

### Solutions

Switch to the `solutions` branch if you want to see the solutions for the exercises as well.
